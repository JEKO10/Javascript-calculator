## Project task

This is fully functional calculator, created using javascript.

## Project overview

I assigned data-num values to numbers and operations buttons. Using eval function, which just calculates the calculator input value, it was easy to make such thing. I also created button for clearing whole calculator input value, and button for deleting last digit.
