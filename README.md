## Project task

This is a fully functional calculator, created using javascript.

## Project overview

I assigned data-num values to numbers and operations buttons. Using the eval function, which just calculates the calculator input value, it was easy to make such a thing. I also created a button for clearing the whole calculator input value and a button for deleting the last digit. 

## Built with
